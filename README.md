# CodeAlpha_ImageGallery

I created an interactive, dark-themed image gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Key features include:

- Gradient Background & Neon Header: A stylish dark gradient with a glowing header for a modern look.
- Thumbnail Grid Layout: Thumbnails in rows of four with equal spacing for organized browsing.
- Lightbox Modal with Navigation: Click to view images in full-size with left/right navigation arrows.
- Responsive Design: Adapts smoothly to various screen sizes.

This project showcases my skills in frontend development, UX design, and creating responsive, interactive interfaces.
